The idea is put together a growing collection of interesting problems/puzzles
solved by binary search (or like) technique

New ideas, improvements welcome.


Currently implemented binary-search based algorithms
- binary search (itelf)
- Find square root
- Find tipping point in a sorted, rotated array
- Binary search in a sorted, rotated Array


Other helper algorithms
- Rotate an arrary/list (without using extra space)
